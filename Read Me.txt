The UAV function here prunes the path based  on :
1. It visits all the points which lie on the line formed by two points.
2. Calculates the expected height of every point.
3. For any point on the line, If expected height is lesser than the terrain height at that point, add the point just before it and start looking from there.
4. If all points passes the test, move to another point, to check if it can be directly connected.

Blue line Shows the Pruned path, whereas black line shows the path obtained from RRT
